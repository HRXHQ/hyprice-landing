## Overview

The Hyprice Landing Page is a simple, single-page website that introduces users to Hyprice and encourages them to install the Hyprice Chrome extension. Key elements include:

- **Networking Particles Background:** A dynamic particle network effect created with [Vanta.NET](https://github.com/tengbao/vanta) that reacts to mouse movements.
- **Custom Hero Section:** A hero area featuring a custom hero image (in place of text), an info text describing the extension, and an "Install Extension" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Referral Support:** If the website is visited with a referral code (e.g., `?ref=HP123456789`), a referral notice is displayed under the Install Extension button.

## Features

- **Modern UI:** Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with a dark, modern aesthetic.
- **Networking Particles:** Uses Vanta.NET for an interactive, animated background effect.
- **Custom Hero Image:** Replaceable hero image for a unique brand look.
